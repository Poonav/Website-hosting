<h2>A basic HTML table</h2>

<table style="width:75%">
  <tr>
    <th>PLANETS</th>
    <th>DESCRIPTION</th>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>SUN</td>
  <td> A star is a hot, glowing ball of gas. When you look up in the night sky, you can see countless twinkling stars. 
  Can you see any stars during the daytime? Of course! The light of daytime comes from our closest star: the Sun</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>MOON</td>
  <td>Earth has just one moon – a rocky, cratered place, roughly a quarter the size of Earth and an average of 238,855 miles away. 
  The Moon can be seen with the naked eye most nights as it traces its 27-day orbit around our planet. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>MERCURY</td>
  <td>Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface that is covered with craters.
  It has no atmosphere, and it doesn’t have any moons. Mercury likes to keep things simple.

This small planet spins around slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time. 
Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>VENUS</td>
  <td>Venus is unusual because it spins the opposite direction of Earth and most other planets.
  And its rotation is very slow. It takes about 243 Earth days to spin around just once.
  Because it's so close to the Sun, a year goes by fast. It takes 225 Earth days for Venus to go all the way around the Sun. 
  That means that a day on Venus is a little longer than a year on Venus.

Since the day and year lengths are similar, one day on Venus is not like a day on Earth. Here, the Sun rises and sets once each day. 
But on Venus, the Sun rises every 117 Earth days.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>EARTH</td>
  <td> Earth is a terrestrial planet. It is small and rocky.
Earth's atmosphere is the right thickness to keep the planet warm so living things like us can be there. It’s 
the only planet in our solar system we know of that supports life. It is mostly nitrogen, and it has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>MARS</td>
    <td>Mars is a cold desert world. It is half the size of Earth. Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. 
	It's red because of rusty iron in the ground.
	One day on Mars lasts 24.6 hours. It is just a little longer than a day on Earth.
One year on Mars is 687 Earth days. It is almost twice as long as one year on Earth.</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>JUPITER</td>
    <td>Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got massive enough to start burning.
	It is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years.
	Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface, but it may have a solid inner core about the size of Earth.
	Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very well.
	One day on Jupiter goes by in just 10 hours.
One year on Jupiter is the same as 11.8 Earth years.</td>
